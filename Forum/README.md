### Installing

Setting up the application to run on your local machine is very easy.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run 'npm install' inside the 'server' directory to intall all rest server dependencies.
3. Run 'npm install inside the 'client' directory to install all React dependencies.
4. Run the 'start-mongodb' bat file to get an instance of the database.
5. Run 'node server.js' inside the 'server' directory to start the rest server.
6. Run 'npm start' inside the 'client' directory to start the React server.
7. Have fun messing around with the development build.
Say what the step will be
